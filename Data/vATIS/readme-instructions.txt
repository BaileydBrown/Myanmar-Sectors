== VYYY ==
The VYYY facility has 4 operation modes. In order of preference, they are:
1. Simultaneous Opposite Direction Operations (SOD) - landing runway 21, departing runway 03. ILS approach in use.
2. South Operations - landing and departing runway 21. ILS approach in use.
3. North Operations (VMC) - landing and departing runway 03. Visual approaches in use. VMC minima: visbility 5000m, cloud clear below 2000 feet.
4. North Operations (IMC) - landing and departing 03. RNP approach in use.

If the winds are 10 knots or less, OR the traffic levels are not significantly elevated and mixed, mode 1 (SOD) must be nominated. 
If the winds are greater than 10 knots, OR the traffic levels are significantly elevated and mixed, modes 3-4 may be nominated, based on wind direction and circuit area weather conditions (VMC/IMC).
